I believe that computers can now be considered the center of all knowledge â€“ with so much information readily available by simply conducting a single search on a web browser. I am intrigued by contemporary technology and the way it is influencing new generations. When I am not coding I spent most of my time with people because I like people and I learn a lot just by interacting with them. Mentoring young girls is also what I do and during my low moments, I listen to music and read blogs and articles.
